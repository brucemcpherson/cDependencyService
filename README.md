This is a reverse engineer hack of the Google gwt service that changes from time to time. In the script property service create a property called dependencyParams. In April 2016 I changed this to use the autocomplete service, since the dependency service seems to have disappeared. It worls the same way but cannot get so much info.

The value should be set to

{
"permutation":"D999FDA8959C8D7187349AFFF3EE4F3C",
"tail":"|3326EFBA241A9C036104CDEDD0BA4430|_|getInitialAutocompleteUpdate|1|2|3|4|0|"
}
